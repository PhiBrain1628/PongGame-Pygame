# PongGame-Pygame

To this project I built the Pong Game in Python from scratch using Pygame library.

Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972.


## Set Up
To install the Pygame library, use the command below: 

Windwos:

```
pip install pygame
```

MacOS:
```
pip3 install pygame
```

Linux:

pip3 install pygame
